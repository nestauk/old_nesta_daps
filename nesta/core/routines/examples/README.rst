Examples
========

Examples of Luigi routines, from which all other nesta.core routines can be built. Currently we have examples of routines with S3 and database (MySQL) IO, and routines which are entirely batched.

We'd recommend reading Spotify's Luigi_ documentation, and also checking the :ref:`luigihacks_label` documentation which contains modified Luigi modules which (who knows) one day we will suggest as pull requests.
